# Python README.md File Generator

## Within this project I was assigned the task of creating a README file generator. I used modulisation practices, and `InquirerPy`.

## Installation:
Firstly, I started by creating a repository, and cloning it down. After this I established a virtual environment. I installed InquirerPy and took advantage of the available api's. 
- For example: `prompt` & `expand`.

## Usage
This is intended for the purpose of creating a README file which is inline with markdown priciples.
